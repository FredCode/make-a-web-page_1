<h2>Introduction to Web & HTML</h2>

<h3>Basics</h3>
  <div class="concept">
    <p><b>A web page</b> is a text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for hypertext markup language. More details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">here.</a></p>
    <p><b>HTML = language = syntax + rules.</b></p>
    <p>A tag links to Elements that form a tree ; DOM (Document Object Model) is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML.</p>
    <p>An element is created from the opening tag to the closing tag and everything in between is considered <b>content.</b></p>
    <p><b>Content</b> can be empty/text/ or another element.All tags have attributes & values.</p>
    <p><b>Coding</b> happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.</p>
    <p><b>Programmers</b> need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").</p>
    </div>

<h3><b>HTML Vocabulary</b></h3>
  <div class="concept">
    <h4>Tag:</h4>
       <p>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.</p>
    <h4>Element:</h4> 
       <p>An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</p>
    <h4>Attribute:</h4> 
        <p>This is a property of an HTML element. For example, <a href="www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a></p>
    <h4>Inline vs Block Elements:</h4>
        <p>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
  </div>
<h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
  <h3>Basics</h3>
    <div class="concept">
      <h4>What is CSS?</h4></p>
      <p>CSS stands for <b>"Cascading Style Sheets"</b>. It is a <b>language</b> that helps you define the style of the page.</p>
      <p>Similarly as HTML, <b>CSS = specific syntax + rules</b> and allows you to <em>change</em> how elements look on the page (font size, colour, background, position etc.). In CSS, the<em> most specific rule applies.</em></p>
      <h4>CSS Boxes</h4>
      <p>We define boxes with Div tags and create as many Div tags as boxes. You need to use class names so as to know the purpose of each box just by glancing at the code.</p>
      <p>When you read an HTML document as text, there are changes of indentations: the more indented an element is, the more deeply nested </p>
      <h4>The concept of Inheritance</h4>
      <p>Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which <em>properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.</em></p>  
      <h4>Example of CSS Rules</h4>
      <p>Change background = background-color: (A) for attribute </p>
      <p>Add style to certain sections (h1), use div class</p>
      <h4>How to include CSS Styling in the web page</h4>
      <p><em>Method 1</em> consists in writing CSS in the head of the HTML. A reasonable approach for small projects only.</p>
      <p><em>Method 2</em> consists in linking your HTML to a separate CSS file. Much better for larger projetcs.</p>
      <p><em>Method 3</em> consists in writing the style inline with the HTML. Considered not ideal because of code repetition.</p>
</div>

  <h3>Advanced</h3>   
    <div class="concept">
      <h4>Advanced details on CSS Boxes</h4>
      <p><em>Center:</em> Content & nucleus</p>
      <p><em>Padding:</em> Clears an area around the content, affected by background colour of the box. Space inside the box that protects the content directly.</p>
      <p><em>Border:</em> goes around the padding & content. Inherited from the colour property of the box.</p>
      <p><em>Margin:</em> Outer layer, clears an area around the border. No background colour, space between boxes.</p>
      <p><em>Pixels VS %</em>: You can set sizes of the box as pixels or percentages. As a percentage, its size will change based on large /small the screen is while in pixels, size wonâ€™t change.</em></p>
      <h4>Boxing & Positioning</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Each box has 4 components.There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues:
              <ul><li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.</li>
                <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p><u>Regarding Box positioning:</u>
              <ul><li>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</li>
              <li>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</li></ul>
            </p>
  </div>
  <div class="IMPT">
            <p><b>REMINDER: Code, Test & Refine</b></p>
            <p>
    <ol><li>Always look for natural boxes</li>
    <li>Look for repeated styles & semantic elements</li>
    <li>Write your HTML</li>
    <li>Apply Style (from BIG to small)</li>
      <li>Fix Things</li></ol>
            </p>
